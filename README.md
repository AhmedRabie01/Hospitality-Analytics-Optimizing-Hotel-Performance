# Hospitality Analytics Optimizing Hotel Performance

### Overview:

My portfolio showcases an in-depth analysis of hospitality data, focusing on various dimensions such as date-wise trends, hotel specifics, room types, bookings, and revenue-related metrics. Leveraging datasets comprising hotel details, room types, bookings, and performance indicators, I've developed comprehensive insights to optimize hotel operations.

### Objective:

This project aims to empower hospitality businesses with actionable insights to enhance revenue, occupancy rates, and overall guest satisfaction. By analyzing booking patterns, cancellations, and room utilization, it helps hotels strategize and optimize their operations.

### Dashboard Metrics:

The dashboard encapsulates crucial hospitality performance metrics:

- Revenue, Total Bookings, Occupancy %
- Average Rating, Cancellation %, No Show rate %
- Booking % by Platform, Booking % by Room class
- ADR (Average Daily Rate), RevPAR (Revenue Per Available Room)
- Realisation %, Daily Booked Room Nights (DBRN), Daily Sellable Room Nights (DSRN)
- Week-over-Week changes for Revenue, Occupancy %, ADR, RevPAR, Realisation %, DSRN


### Value Proposition:
